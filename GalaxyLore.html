        My name is Mahthom Iq Seerva.
        I am the Winnaran keeper of the Custodian Chronicle, and
        I write this from the ancient Tower of Annals in old Mecatol
        City. Since inheriting the duties of the chronicle from my
        father, I have enjoyed the inspiring views of great buildings,
        ancient towers, and the bright lights of life that stretch into
        the distance. Yet, like the shadow at my feet, I can never
        escape or forget the lethally finite borders of this city. Less
        than a thousand leagues from my tower, great shields protect
        us from the poisonous dust that is the Sea of Desolation, the
        terrible wasteland that covers most of the planet.

        My people, the Winnarans, have kept this city safe for more
        than three thousand years. Ever since the time of the Great
        Scourge, we have been the caretakers of the Imperial Throne,
        the Imperial Records, and the Galactic Council here on
        Mecatol Rex. We have indeed been faithful to the promise
        that we made to the last Emperor.

        My hands tremble as I write this, for events are now unfolding
        which I believe to be the harbinger of great change. I foresee
        that our custodianship will come to an end in my lifetime.
        This is why I have contacted you. I will seek to give you a brief
        yet true summary of the recent history of our galaxy. I give this
        to you because I know that you will spread this knowledge far
        and wide. As we enter the dangerous years before us, I fear
        that the galaxy shall have great need of the past.

        It is told that the Lazax Emperors arose from the ashes of
        the Mahact kings. Little is known of their early ascension,
        but it is impossible to deny that the Lazax must have been
        a profoundly intelligent, benevolent, and wise people.
        After their rise to power, we know that the Lazax chose the
        central planet of Mecatol Rex as their home world. The year
        the Lazax first arrived on Mecatol Rex is recorded in the
        Imperial Chronicle as “first” and marks the beginning of
        my account.

        For ages, the borders of the Lazax Empire expanded outward.
        As inhabited systems were discovered and annexed into the
        Empire, the Lazax allowed these newfound civilizations
        to join the Galactic Council: the governing body that
        represented the needs and voices of the Empire’s people.
        The Great Races: Xxcha, Hacan, Letnev, Hylar, Human, and
        N’orr were all represented in the council, as were hundreds
        of lesser civilizations and independent systems.

        Yet, as the years passed, discoveries of new civilizations and
        planetary systems slowed. Little by little, the mood of the
        Empire changed as technological and intellectual growth
        abated. Craving constant advancement, the Great Races
        began to look to the power of the Lazax and the resources
        of their neighbors. Greed and ambition grew in the hearts
        of statesmen and councilors. The once-noble spirit of the
        Empire turned suspicious and fearful. It is during this time
        that the first conflicts between the Great Races are recorded
        in the Imperial Chronicle. The Galactic Council became a
        seedbed of intrigue, and the turmoil ushered in a time of spies
        and assassins. First in secret, and later in public, the Great
        Races began to build their fleets and armies. Many embarked
        on territorial expansion that extended beyond their original
        charter. Border strife and resource disputes proliferated,
        gnawing at the very foundations of the Empire. This was a
        time of growing darkness known now as the Age of Dusk.
        Throughout most of this age, the Lazax still held authority
        without question. Except for a few minor and unsuccessful
        rebellions, few dared to openly challenge the Emperors.
        Blinded by millennia of unchallenged rule, the Lazax could
        not perceive the mounting ambition and discontent that grew
        around them. As centuries passed, tensions between the Great
        Races grew deeper, and so did their desire for power and
        control. In the end, hatred was their only common ground:
        hatred for the Lazax, Imperial rule, and for the benevolent
        arrogance of the emperors.

        A small affair near the Quann Wormhole was the spark that
        would set the galaxy aflame.

        Protesting Imperial trade oversight, the Baron of Letnev
        began a blockade of traffic through the Quann Wormhole.
        Because the prickly Letnev had often been troublesome, an
        unconcerned and unhurried Emperor sought to solve the
        conflict through the Galactic Council.

        However, the blockade obstructed significant Sol trading
        activities and prevented vital supplies from reaching a
        handful of Sol colonies that soon were struck by famine and
        disease. After nearly eight months of fruitless debate in the
        Galactic Council, the patience of the Sol Federation ran dry.
        Without warning, the blockading Letnev ships were attacked
        and annihilated by a Sol task force acting without Imperial
        mandate, and the Quann Passage was reopened.

        Angered by the unilateral militancy of both Letnev and Sol,
        the Emperor attempted to consolidate his control by issuing
        the Maandu Edict: a rule which would place all warships
        under direct Imperial supervision.

        The Maandu Edict was the stone that shattered the brittle
        Empire. The Letnev, Sol, and Jol-Nar civilizations announced
        their immediate withdrawal from the Council, drawing the
        galaxy into civil war. The Quann Conflict marks the beginning
        of the Age of Twilight.

        As civilization fought civilization—as a thousand territorial
        disputes erupted over a few years—the Lazax desperately
        sought to hold together their crumbling Empire. Imperial
        fleets fought across the galaxy, but their power was ultimately
        stretched too thin. In the seventy-third year of the war, an
        alliance of Sol, Jol-Nar, and Hacan launched a surprise
        attack on Mecatol Rex itself. The last Lazax Emperor and his
        entire family were killed during the first Sol bombardments,
        and no successor was named.

        Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more wartorn
        than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years,
        the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its
        population nearly wiped out, and its green fields blasted into
        a toxic wasteland.

        After the death of the Emperor and the loss of the throneworld,
        Imperial control collapsed. The Lazax became hunted
        across the galaxy in the vengeful wave of murder that is
        known now as the Great Scourge. Lasting only twenty years,
        the scourge resulted in the near-complete annihilation of the
        Lazax race. Until recently, no Lazax had been seen in the
        galaxy for more than three thousand years.

        The Twilight Wars continued for centuries, but no race
        was powerful enough to seize the throne and risk suffering
        a similar fate as the Emperor. Slowly, the strength of great
        civilizations failed as their economies crumbled and as
        knowledge and technology was lost in the destruction and
        strain of long war.

        And so the Age of Twilight ended in a slow whisper. The time
        that followed, now known as the Dark Years, was a period
        of economic, cultural, and intellectual collapse. The Great
        Races retreated into their own small, safe areas of space,
        abandoning what they could no longer hold by force. After
        several millennia, the Dark Years came to an end, and a calm
        but uncertain period of rebuilding began.

        As I write this, the Great Races of the galaxy have regained
        elements of their former strength. Here on Mecatol Rex, the
        Galactic Council is growing in influence once more, while
        civilizations new and old, are re-colonizing the neighboring
        systems abandoned during the Dark Years.

        Signs of great change are everywhere. This year, as if
        walking out of ancient prophecy, the Lazax returned from the
        darkness of history in a foreboding cybernetic form. To me,
        their coming is like the first wind of a terrible storm. I feel
        as if the galaxy is waking—as if an ancient beast stirs from
        slumber in a dark cave.

        The day will soon come when a new Empire will rise. For the
        sake of all, may the new Emperor have not only the power to
        seize the throne, but the strength to conquer the peace.
        If not, I fear that a sea of desolation will drown us all.
